# Csv to MSSQL

This extension is for personal use, you can use it or contribute if you want ðŸ˜Š.

It's my first personal project so it probably won't be as well documented or developed as it could be, I'll try to do my best.

## How to build it
It should work with the next two lines:
```shell
npm install

vsce package
```

This will install all the dependencies and make a **.vsix** to install it in vscode.
