# csv-to-mssql

This extension is for personal use, you can use it or contribute if you want ðŸ˜Š.

It's my first personal project so it probably won't be as well documented or developed as it could be, I'll try to do my best.

## 1.0
It adds a command that converts a csv to MSSQL Inserts, you can type the name of the table.
